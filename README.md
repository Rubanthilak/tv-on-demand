# TV on Demand

![Ref-Image](/md/ref-image.png)

I came across this UI in Pintrest, got curious to try out and planned to create this as a fully functional website that can provide info on movies, series and etc. 

I used OMDb API to retrive Movie and Series Content. You can check about OMDb API [here](http://www.omdbapi.com/).    

### Project Tour

1. `style` <br/>
    - `js` <br/>
        - `helper` : contains *tweaky* functions
        - `views` : provides the dynamic HTML content as views.
    - `scss` :  compiled to css & stored as `/src/css/style.css`<br/> 
2. `svg` : image folder<br/>


### To run this app locally,
